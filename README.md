# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `how to Run`

open the project files directory's terminal and enter ### `npm start` this will automatically open a new tab in your default browser with host being shown as localhost in port 3000. \
Now here you can use the web application as you like by coding any of the html, css and javascript languages to see their real-time output on the right side of the editor. \

All the errors also will be highlighted(lints) right at the time of the coding itself so you check those and type accordingly. \

All the progress will be saved in the local storage of the running machine so that you can stop and pickup from that point without any hassle. \
